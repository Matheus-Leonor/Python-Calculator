# Python Calculator Challenge
A simple algorithm that receives from the user the coefficients (a,b,c) of a quadratic equation and calculates the roots using the formula -b±√(b²-4ac))/(2a). Considering also that:

if delta > 0: The equation produces two real roots.
if delta ==0: The equation produces a real root.
if delta < 0: The equation does not produce real roots.
In this challenge, the program should inform how many real roots the equation has, but it will need some commits until it meets the proposal well. At the moment it only tells you whether the roots are real or not.
